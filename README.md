# Oscars,Ratings,and Films-Oh Py!

## Background

It seems like a bygone activity of yesteryear, but yes people did go to movie theaters. With the advent of streaming services and well Covid, most of us are enjoying film from the comfort of our couch.  We have many movie options! How do we know if what we select is “quality” and if something is “quality” is it something the average streamer really wants to watch?
We extracted data from an Academy Awards Database and a Streaming Services database to try and determine: 

* Do award winning films actually have high user ratings?
* Do awards impact film popularity on streaming services?
* Do award winning directors receive higher ratings?
* Do films with winning soundtracks have higher popularity?

## Extraction  

The first dataset was extracted from Kaggle.com in CSV.  This data included details on movie titles, user ratings, streaming services supporting the film, director, and release year, genres, and runtime. 

The team leveraged DataHub for the second dataset extraction in JSON format.  This data set provided details year, award category, winner (T/F), and winner name.  

Both datasets were downloaded and imported into Python for cleaning.
